<div class='senator__name'>Scott DesJarlais</div>
<div class='senator__dist'>DesJarlais is the representative for Tennessee’s 4th congressional district and is a Republican.</div>
<div class='senator__affil'>DesJarlais is among the Republican legislators whose attempt to disenfranchise Democratic states in the 2020 presidential
     election was a part of the months-long attempted coup that included the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol. 
     Shortly after the 2020 election, DesJarlais joined a case before the Supreme Court calling for all the votes for president
      in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — states that were narrowly won by Democrats — to be discounted based
       on lies, conspiracy theories, and a preposterous legal argument which the Supreme Court rejected. Following the rejection
        of several related cases before the Supreme Court, another legislator who joined the case called for violence. 
        On January 6, 2021 in the hours after the attack on the Capitol, DesJarlais voted for the exclusion of all of the votes
         in Arizona and/or Pennsylvania — states narrowly won by Democrats — from the Electoral College count that determined 
         the next President of the United States. These legislators have generally changed their story after their vote, claiming 
         it was merely a protest and not intended to change the outcome of the election as they clearly sought prior to the vote.</div>
